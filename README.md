# LEISIApp

## About us
Lesionia is an open-source software/Web applications for the collection, management and analysis 
of clinical and epidemiological data related to patients suspected for cutaneous leishmaniasis.
Initially conceived and developed in the frame of the PEER518 project, it is meant to enable 
researchers within the project consortium to enter and access the data with respect to the FAIR criteria.
It offers a remote and secured access via a web-based interface to all users that are based in different 
countries and acting at different stages of the data life cycle.

### Requirements:
- LEMP software stack (i.e. a variation on the LAMP software bundle that uses Nginx rather than Apache, also known as LNMP : Linux Nginx MySql Php)
- R (why not Rstudio or any other R IDE)
- Shiny and Shiny-server
- Basic knowlage of linux comand lines 

#### Installation using Rstudio (graphical mode) suitable for both Linux and Windows [Coming soon]




#### Installation using command-lines under Ubuntu 16.04. This section also includes the R packages and their dependencies

1. Supposing that you have a linux base OS (you can Download UBUNTU 16.04 from [here](http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/)).
2. Setting up MySql from [here](https://linuxize.com/series/how-to-install-lemp-stack-on-ubuntu-18-04/).
3. Installing PhpMyAdmin with nginx [here](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-phpmyadmin-with-nginx-on-ubuntu-18-04/) & [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/phpmyadmin-got-404-not-found-error-on-nginx-ubuntu-16-04).
4. Don't forget `sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'` and `sudo ufw enable`
5. Install R `sudo apt-get install r-base-core r-base-dev`
   - [Optional] Install your favorite R ide (for RStudio see [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)).
6. Installing Linux librarys `sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev libv8-dev libxml2-dev  libcairo2-dev libpoppler-cpp-dev libwebp-dev libxt-dev libgtk2.0-dev libcairo2-dev xvfb xauth xfonts-base libpq-dev unixodbc-dev  libudunits2-dev libtiff5-dev libfftw3-dev`
7. Adding repositories 
   ```
   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:marutter/c2d4u3.5
   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:marutter/rrutter
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt full-upgrade
   ```
8. Installing the R packages 
   ```
   library(remotes) 
   install_version("car", "3.0-2") 
   install_version('caret','6.0-80') 
   source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R") 
   install.packages("tiff","fftwtools") 
   biocLite("EBImage")
   install.packages(c("Hmisc","RODBC","RODBCext","DT","ggplot2","zoo","V8","googleVis","cluster","wordcloud","lubridate","multcompView","dygraphs","forecast","GGally","plotly","sqldf","ggmap","labelled","RColorBrewer","ade4", "caret", "doBy", "factoextra", "FactoMineR", "ggdendro","shiny", "shinyjs", "shinydashboard","tm")) 
   ```
   > Please note that if a package is outdated could not install with install.packages("package_name") 
   you should use install_version("package_name", "version_number") or simply go to [section 6 of this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25721884/how-should-i-deal-with-package-xxx-is-not-available-for-r-version-x-y-z-wa/31293955)

9. ODBC DNS Config file
   - Download libmyodbc8a.so from [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/odbc/)
   and place it in **/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/odbc/**
   - In **/etc/odbc.ini** write
   ```
   [MyAppDB]
   Description = ODBC connection to a database
   Driver = /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/odbc/libmyodbc8a.so
   Database =  #the name your database
   Server = localhost #the name your database server localhost if you are using a local database as shown in this file
   User = "" #the uid your database privileged user
   Password = "" #itâ€™s password 
   Port = 3838 #the port number 3838
   ```
10. Setting up ShinyServer with Nginx see [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-shiny-server-on-ubuntu-16-04).
    - Set the following configuration in **/etc/shiny-server/shiny-server.conf**
      ```
      # Instruct Shiny Server to run applications as the user "shiny"
      #run_as shiny;
      run_as :HOME_USER: ; # if :HOME_USER: does not work try your username
      
      #websocket error
      app_init_timeout 1800;
      app_idle_timeout 1800;
      http_keepalive_timeout 1800;
      sockjs_heartbeat_delay 500;
      disable_websockets off;
      
      # Define a server that listens on port 3838
      server {
        listen 3838;
      
        # Define a location at the base URL
        location / {
      
          # Host the directory of Shiny Apps stored in this directory
          site_dir /srv/shiny-server;
      
          # Log all Shiny output to files in this directory
          log_dir /var/log/shiny-server;
      
          # When a user visits the base URL rather than a particular application,
          # an index of the applications available in this directory will be shown.
          directory_index on;
        
      }
      ```
    - Restart shinyServer `sudo systemctl restart shiny-server.service`
